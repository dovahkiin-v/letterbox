"""Shared pytest fixtures for the letterbox test suite.

Two load-bearing fixtures land here per Cross-Cutting §13.1 — the
"Migration Test Kit First" mandate:

* ``tmp_letterbox_home`` — isolated ``~/.letterbox/`` per test. Sets
  ``LETTERBOX_HOME`` via monkeypatch and creates the directory with mode
  ``0700`` (Vision §6.4). Used by every test that touches the protocol,
  channel, or config layer.
* ``fake_harness`` — handle pointing at the bundled ``fake_harness.py``
  script. Used by every adapter / launcher / e2e test that needs to
  spawn a real subprocess representing a CLI harness.

The fixtures are deliberately minimal. Tests that need a populated
channel directory build it on top of ``tmp_letterbox_home``; tests that
need the harness to misbehave wrap or substitute it explicitly. See
``IMPLEMENTATION_NOTES`` for the resist-anticipation rule.

    Sets ``LETTERBOX_HOME`` for the duration of the test and creates the
    directory eagerly with mode ``0o700`` so Vision §6.4's permissions
    check has something to find.

    IMPORTANT — module-scope env reads (G2): tests that import a module
    which reads ``LETTERBOX_HOME`` at *import* time will get the wrong
    value, because monkeypatch fires when the fixture is *invoked*, not
    when the test module loads. Use the fixture only with code paths
    that read the env at call time (per the planned ``config.resolve_state_dir``
    contract). If a future module reads the env at import, it needs a
    reload helper, not this fixture.

    Worker safety (G5): ``tmp_path`` is per-test-per-worker isolated under
    ``pytest-xdist``, so ``-n auto`` is safe. No shared global state is
    introduced by this fixture.
